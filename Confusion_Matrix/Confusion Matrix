A confusion matrix is a summary of prediction results on a classification problem.

The number of correct and incorrect predictions are summarized with count values and broken down by each class. This is the key to the confusion matrix.

The confusion matrix shows the ways in which your classification model
is confused when it makes predictions.

It gives you insight not only into the errors being made by your classifier but more importantly the types of errors that are being made.

It is this breakdown that overcomes the limitation of using classification accuracy alone.
